I will be making a game similar to Space Invaders.

1. Enemies fall from the top of the screen in organized patterns
2. Enemies are represented by 3 different sprites
3. The 3 different enemies require different numbers of attacks to destroy them
3. The user is represented by a space ship
4. The user shoots enemies using the space bar
5. The user is moved by using the left and right arrows
6. As the game progresses, it becomes more difficult 
   * The enemy mass will move faster towards the user
   * The enemy mass will assemble in more difficult patterns (ie, more spread out or                        more enemies in a mass)
   * Enemies will shoot at the user and the user will need to avoid it
7. When an enemy is shot down, the score goes up 10 points (which is displayed on the screen)
8. If an enemy touches the user, the user loses a life and the game continues after a short pause
9. The user has 3 lives
